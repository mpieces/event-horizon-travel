# event-horizon-travel
freelance front-end site project
This is an almost completed homepage design project for a luxury travel company. After talking to the owner, I designed a few ideas in Sketch, and then started coding. The copy content is yet to be added, but I was able to solidify my knowledge of mobile-first design and responsiveness by doing this project. I also learned how to integrate animation, a photo gallery, and practice with jQuery and Javascript!
